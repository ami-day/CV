## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ami :) Before Makers I was working on curating biological research data for a large, international database which is used by research scientists to explore the distinct cell types in the human body. During this time, I worked with software engineers who were developing the interactive user interface and back-end of this website. Seeing the huge impact of the technology on the Life Sciences field inspired my interest in software engineering and in particular, full-stack web development. It is the impact that technology has in our work and everyday lives that excites me about coding, in addition to the multitude of opportunities to problem solve and learn continuously. I am really interested and excited to further explore the impact of software engineering in other industries in addition.

## Work Experience

**EMBL-EBI** (Jan 2020 to Dec 2023)  
_Bioinformatician (Curation)_

- Curated Life Sciences research data and submitted this data to a large, international database in monthly release cycles.
- Developed python scripts to improve the automation of curation practises within the team.
- Worked with external researchers to understand their requirements and to design curation appraoches which reflected their requirements and feedback.

**DNA Electronics** (Jan 2017 to Dec 2019)  
_BioAnalyst_

- Worked on product research & development of a Next Generation Sequencing based medical device to diagnose Sepsis.
- Designed Molecular Biology experiments and tests for detection of bacterial species DNA.
- Analysed performance of Molecular Biology experiments, improving on experiment designs iteratively in a collaborative team environment.
  
## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker and Problem-Solver
I first developed my analytical skills while studying for my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry, for example, learning how new discoveries in the Life Sciences originated from generating and experimentally testing hyotheses. I further developed this skill while working as a BioAnalyst at DNA Electronics, a start-up company which is developing a Next-generation sequencing diagnostic device for Sepsis. As part of my role, I was resonsible for generating and analysing positive and negative test cases to assess experiment performance. For example, to test for the presence or absence of bacterial species DNA in a biological sample. In addition, I employed problem-solving skills to identify the cause of experimental output data which did not reflect expected test results. During my time at Makers I similarly have utilised analystical and problem-solving skills in a different context, writing computational test cases during test-driven development and solving programming errors.

#### Fast Learner
During my career I have worked on a variety of projects within the Life Sciences sector, from Cancer Research, Infectious Diseases Research and a project to map all the distinct cell types in the human body. In addition, during this time, I worked in a range of settings including Academia, Government and Industry. I have very much enjoyed this varied experience, which has required learning new topics and skills quickly, as well as an adaptive, flexible approach to working in different contexts and environments, including internationally. For example, during my time working at DNA Electronics, I learnt to work in a fast-changing, collaborative environment in which I was resonsible for communicating my work frequently in team meetings and worked with others to clarify next steps and goals. At EMBL-EBI, I learnt to work with software engineers in agile software development cycles, in which I was responsible for user testing new product features towards the end of biweekly sprints. I also learnt to collaboratively track my work using Github and project management software (Zenhub). At Makers, I have consolidated my experience using Github to work on code collaboratively during frequent pair-programming sessions.

#### Good Communicator
Throughout my academic education and career I have communicated scientific research work in a multitude of written reports and presentations. This has required close attention to detail but also an ability to interpret and translate small details into a "big picture" view. At EMBL-EBI, as part of my role I was responsible for gathering requirements for a large, international research database and recieving feedback from external researchers who were using this database product. This required communicating team goals effectively and concisely to others outside the team, good time management in meetings and good listening skills to understand the user. While working at EMBL-EBI I also set up a voluntary educational coding project for a Festival of Science based in Cambridge using a "BBC Microbit" (mini computer). To do this, I developed educational material aimed at children and complete beginners which focused on using "coding blocks" to demonstrate controlling a temperature warning alarm within a mini fridge. To do this, I had to think creatively about how to demonstrate coding logic I employed in Python in BBC microbit "coding blocks", taking into account an audience with differing abilities and speed of learning. At Makers I have worked on Pair Programming with a multitute of other students which has helped to hone my skills in receiving and giving feedback.

## Hobbies

I love to travel and explore cultures different to my own, which reflects my love of diving into the unknown and learning new skills, information and mindsets.
