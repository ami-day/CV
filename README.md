## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ami :) Before Makers I was working on curating biological research data for a large, international database which is used by research scientists to explore the distinct cell types in the human body. During this time, I worked with software engineers who were developing the interactive user interface and back-end of this website. Seeing the huge impact of the technology on the Life Sciences field inspired my interest in software engineering and in particular, full-stack web development. It is the impact that technology has in our work and everyday lives that excites me about coding, in addition to the multitude of opportunities to problem solve and learn continuously. I am really interested and excited to further explore the impact of software engineering in other industries.
