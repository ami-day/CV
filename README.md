## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ami :) Before Makers I was working on curating biological research data for a large, international database which is used by research scientists to explore the distinct cell types in the human body. During this time, I worked with software engineers who were developing the interactive user interface and back-end of this website. Seeing the huge impact of the technology on the Life Sciences field inspired my interest in software engineering and in particular, full-stack web development. It is the impact that technology has in our work and everyday lives that excites me about coding, in addition to the multitude of opportunities to problem solve and learn continuously. I am really interested and excited to further explore the impact of software engineering in other industries in addition.

## Work Experience

**EMBL-EBI** (Jan 2020 to Dec 2023)  
_Bioinformatician (Curation)_

- Curated Life Sciences research data and submitted this data to a large, international database in monthly release cycles.
- Developed python scripts to improve the automation of curation practises within the team.
- Worked with external researchers to understand their requirements and to design curation appraoches which reflected their requirements and feedback.

**DNA Electronics** (Jan 2017 to Dec 2019)  
_BioAnalyst_

- Worked on product research & development of a Next Generation Sequencing based medical device to diagnose Sepsis.
- Designed Molecular Biology experiments and tests for detection of bacterial species DNA.
- Analysed performance of Molecular Biology experiments, improving on experiment designs iteratively in a collaborative team environment.
  
## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker and Problem-Solver
I first developed my analytical skills while studying for my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry, for example, learning how new discoveries in the Life Sciences originated from generating and experimentally testing hyotheses. I further developed this skill while working as a BioAnalyst at DNA Electronics, a start-up company which is developing a Next-generation sequencing diagnostic device for Sepsis. As part of my role, I was resonsible for generating and analysing positive and negative test cases to assess experiment performance. For example, to test for the presence or absence of bacterial species DNA in a biological sample. In addition, I employed problem-solving skills to identify the cause of experimental output data which did not reflect expected test results. During my time at Makers I similarly have utilised analystical and problem-solving skills in a different context, writing computational test cases during test-driven development and solving programming errors.

#### Fast learner


#### Agile and flexible team-player


## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2023 to Oct 2023)
- Applied Object-Oriented Programming in Python and Javascript ?
- Applied Test-Driven Development to solve coding challenges with robust and clean code, requiring analystical mindset and attention to detail.
- Frequently worked on pair-programming with other Makers students, requiring good communication, teamwork and ability to give and recieve feedback.

#### University of Cambridge (Oct 2013 to June 2014)

- MPhil Computational Biology

#### University of Manchester (Sept 2009 to July 2013)

- BSc (Hons) Biochemistry
- 1:1

## Hobbies

I like to travel and explore cultures different to my own, which reflects my love of diving into the unknown and learning new skills, information and mindsets.
