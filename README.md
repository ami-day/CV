## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ami :) Before Makers I was working on curating biological research data for a large-scale, web-based database which is used by research scientists internationally. During this time, I worked with software engineers who were developing the interactive user interface and back-end of this website. Seeing the impact of the technology on the Life Sciences field inspired my interest in software engineering and in particular, full-stack web development. It is the impact that technology has on our everyday lives that excites me about coding, in addition to the multitude of opportunities to problem solve and learn continuously. I am really interested and excited to further explore the impact of software engineering in other fields.

## Work Experience

**EMBL-EBI** (Jan 2020 to Dec 2023)  
_Bioinformatician (Curation)_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**DNA Electronics** (start-date to end-date)  
_BioAnalyst_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
