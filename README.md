## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ami :) Before Makers I was working on curating biological research data for a large, international database which is used by research scientists to explore the distinct cell types in the human body. During this time, I worked with software engineers who were developing the interactive user interface and back-end of this website. Seeing the huge impact of the technology on the Life Sciences field inspired my interest in software engineering and in particular, full-stack web development. It is the impact that technology has on our everyday lives that excites me about coding, in addition to the multitude of opportunities to problem solve and learn continuously. I am really interested and excited to further explore the impact of software engineering in other industries.

## Work Experience

**EMBL-EBI** (Jan 2020 to Dec 2023)  
_Bioinformatician (Curation)_

- Curated Life Sciences research data and submitted this data to a large, international database in monthly release cycles.
- Developed python scripts to improve the automation of curation practises within the team.
- Worked with external researchers to understand their requirements and to design curation appraoches which reflected their requirements and feedback.

**DNA Electronics** (Jan 2017 to Dec 2019)  
_BioAnalyst_

- Worked on product research & development of a Next Generation Sequencing based medical device to diagnose Sepsis.
- Designed Molecular Biology experiments for detection of bacterial species DNA.
- Analysed performance of Molecular Biology experiments, improving on experiment designs iteratively in a collaborative team environment.
  
## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker and Problem-Solver
EXAMPLE
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
